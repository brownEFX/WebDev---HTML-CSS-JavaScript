<h1>CSS Great Font Pairings</h1>
	<pre><p>
	Great font pairings are essential to great design.
	</p></pre>

<h2>Font Pairing Rules</h>
	<pre><p>
	1. Complement
		**It is always safe to find font pairings that complement one another.
		**A great font combination should harmonize, without being too similar or too different.

	2. Use Font Superfamilies
		**A font superfamily is a set of fonts designed to work well together. So, using different fonts within the same superfamily is safe.
		**For example, the Lucida superfamily contains the following fonts: Lucida Sans, Lucida Serif, Lucida Typewriter Sans, Lucida Typewriter Serif and Lucida Math.

	3. Contrast is King
	**Two fonts that are too similar will often conflict. However, contrasts, done the right way, brings out the best in each font.
	**Example: Combining serif with sans serif is a well known combination.
	**A strong superfamily includes both serif and sans serif variations of the same font (e.g. Lucida and Lucida Sans).

	4. Choose Only One Boss
	**One font should be the boss. This establishes a hierarchy for the fonts on your page. This can be achieved by varying the size, weight and color.
	
	<strong>Example 1:</strong>
			
	/style>
	body {
	  background-color: black;
	  font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
	  font-size: 16px;
	  color: gray;  
	}

	h1 {
	  font-family: Georgia, serif;
	  font-size: 60px;
	  color: white;
	}
	/style>
