This post explains the functioning of the "stack" data structure.

A data structure provides a format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. When used appropriately they help improve the efficiency of handling data.

A stack works just like a stack of plates except here we use data instead of plates. We add plates to the top and remove plates from the top. The last plate to get on the stack is the first to go out. To get to a plate on the bottom you first have to remove the plates above it. So the principle of this structure is called LIFO( Last In First Out ).

In this example I have used a java array to show the working of a stack. The maximum allowed size of the stack is determined at the point of creating the stack. But remember that the size of it at any given time is determined by the number of data that have been added into the stack. This size will be less than or equal to the maximum allowed size. Push and Pop are the standard names of the methods used to add and remove data.

Space complexity( for n push operations) O(n)
Time complexity to create the stack O(1)
Time complexity to push and pop O(1)

One instance where the stack is used is in memory to store data regarding method calls. This stack is known as the method call stack. This allows us to have nested methods and recursion.

Another way to implement the stack is to link objects called nodes one after the other. Also there is a Stack class in the API which puts out the need to write a stack by ourselves. I wish to post on those as well.
Play around with this data structure and you'll soon get the hang of it.

//1.1. Empty Array
var array = [];

var top = -1;

var size = {
    array = var : newArray[size];
    }
